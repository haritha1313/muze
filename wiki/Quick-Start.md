## Tips for Best Experience

### üé≠ For Accurate Emotion Detection

- **Good lighting**: Face the light source
- **Center your face**: Look directly at camera
- **Clear expression**: Show your emotion clearly

- **Check after 20 songs**: See how your mood changes

### üîÑ For Continuous Use

- **Restart anytime**: Click "Get more music" for fresh playlist
- **View your journey**: Click "Stop WebCam" to see emotion timeline
- **Multiple sessions**: Each session is independent
