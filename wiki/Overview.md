# Overview

## What is Muze?

**Muze** is an AI-powered music therapy web application that analyzes your emotions in real-time and creates personalized music playlists to match or improve your mood. Using advanced facial recognition technology, Muze detects your emotional state and selects songs from a curated library designed to complement your feelings.

## The Problem

Music has a profound impact on our emotional well-being, but finding the right music for your current mood can be challenging. Traditional music apps require manual selection and don't adapt to your emotional state in real-time.

## The Solution

Muze combines:
- **Computer Vision**: Real-time facial emotion detection via webcam
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithmia's deep learning emotion recognition model
- **Music Psychology**: Scientifically-organized music library based on emotional clusters
- **Adaptive Playlists**: Dynamic song selection that responds to mood changes

## How It Works

1. **Capture**: Your webcam captures your facial expression
2. **Analyze**: AI analyzes your face to detect emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Neutral)
3. **Select**: Algorithm selects songs from emotional clusters matching your mood
4. **Play**: Personalized playlist starts playing automatically
5. **Adapt**: Every 20 songs, Muze rechecks your emotion and adjusts the playlist
